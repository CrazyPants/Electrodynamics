Electrodynamics
===============

Electrodynamics is a mod, yes ... but what does it mean?

Many of you will see the word "electro" and assume that this mod is about electricity. It's not. Electrodynamics is the branch of physics concerned with the interaction of electric currents with magnetic fields or with other electric currents... but what does that mean? We'll get to that later.
We are embracing a semi-realistic, immersive playstyle guided towards bringing the player closer to the crafting aspect of Minecraft and filling in all of the gaps of Vanilla. Expect a challenge that will require creativity, strategy and knowledge; not simply overpriced recipes and tedious crafting.
Electrodynamics is a diverse mod covering all the basics: power, processing, crafting, aesthetics. We strive to create the single mod that has everything, yet works with all the other mods. It fits in nicely yet will be the one mod that can do it all on its own; the one mod you need to have.
